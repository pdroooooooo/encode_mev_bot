# encode_mev_bot

June 04, 2023

This is a team project for the project week of the Encode Solidity Bootcamp. We deploy an ERC20 token $MATH and add liquidity in Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap pools. We also write a script that monitors the Goerli mempool to detect transactions involving our token, do an analysis on their price impacts and, ideally, trade using that information.
